## The Problem
Bringing in new engineers to your team means tediously setting up lots of software.Ansika helps build <strong>hassle-free custom one-line installers,</strong> saving your team time, effort, and money. 
## Overview

Ansika simplifies bulk software installation and configuration tasks into a single command. It reduces the employee onboarding workload for technical leads and engineers. In a few steps, Ansika installs and configures software, libraries, and extensions for new employees or interns.

Ansika produces a binary file that does not requires external dependencies. Simply define software, libraries, and configurations in the Ansible playbook file ([one_installer.yml](https://github.com/HexmosTech/Ansika/blob/main/one_installer.yml)). Ansika will release a new binary in GitHub releases. The one-line command downloads, authorizes and executes the binary file on local machines.

## Benefits

- Install any combination of software packages, libraries and extensions
- Run commands and configure setting files
- Produce zero-dependency binaries
- Provide one-liner to perform every on-boarding task
- 100% Free and Open Source Software
- Built upon solid tech: Ansible and Nuitka (Python)


## Usage

### Fork the Repository

To create the one-line installer for your team or company, begin by forking this repository.After forking, you can make changes locally to tailor the code or content according to your specific requirements.

### Requirements

- python: Version 2.7 or 3.5 and higher
- Ansible: Version 2.7 or higher (depends on python version installed)
- Nuitka: Version 1.7.5 or higher

### Installing Requirements

- Install Ansible : `pip3 install ansible==7.0.0`
- Install Nuitka : `pip3 install nuitka==1.7.5`
### Modify Ansible Playbook 

 Modify the ansible playbook file in this repository ([one_installer.yml](https://github.com/HexmosTech/Ansika/blob/main/one_installer.yml)) to include additional instructions for installing software packages, tools, extensions, and configurations. For further insights into ansible and ansible playbook, you can refer to the [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Local Testing

We recommend testing the binary within a Docker container first. Docker isolates your Ansible installation and binary file execution from the rest of your system. Here's the procedure :

- Begin by pulling the Ubuntu 20.04 image from Docker Hub : 
 ```bash
 docker pull ubuntu:20.04
 ```

- Run an Ubuntu container named `my_ubuntu_container` with an interactive shell, a mounted volume, and start a bash session : 
```bash
docker run -it --name my_ubuntu_container -v ~/Docker_Share:/data ubuntu /bin/bash
```
- The mounted volume facilitates file sharing between the Docker container and the host machine through the `Docker_Share` directory in your host machine. 


#### Ansible Python API

- Specify the ansible playbook file that should be executed inside the executor.py
- Adjust the playbook file path in the [executor.py](https://github.com/HexmosTech/Ansika/blob/main/executor.py#L47) file.
- You can refer [Ansible Python API](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_api.html) for more details about the code.

#### Build Binary using Nuitka 

For building the binary file run the command:

```bash

python3 -m nuitka --onefile \
--include-package-data=ansible:'*.py' \
--include-package-data=ansible:'*.yml' \
--include-data-files=one_installer.yml=one_installer.yml \
 executor.py
```

The `--include-package-data` option tells Nuitka to include all files that match the specified pattern in the package data of the specified module. In this case, the pattern *.py and *.yml will match all Python files and YAML files in the ansible module.

The `--include-data-files=one_installer.yml=one_installer.yml` option tells Nuitka to include the ansible playbook file `one_installer.yml` in the distribution.

You may refer to the [Nuitka user manual](https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html) for more information on the available options.

#### Executing binary
First copy the binary file from the host machine to the docker container : 
```bash
sudo cp executor.bin ~/Docker_Share
```

The shared files can be found in the `data` directory inside the docker container :
```bash
cd /data
```
Run the executable binary file :
```bash
./executor.bin
```

If you encounter any permission issues run :
```bash
chmod +x executor.bin 
``` 



### Release and One-line command

Release the binary file and generate a one line command easily using the github actions and workflows.

#### Github Workflow

The github workflow mentioned in the file [build-and-release.yml](./.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml) will handle the binary creation and release of the binary.

- First commit your changes.
- Then create a tag name using the command `git tag v1.0.0`.
- Push the tag `git push v1.0.0`.

If you encounter any permission issues in the workflow follow this steps:

- Go to the repository "Settings".
- After that, it will show you a left pane where you will find "Actions"
- Expand the "Actions" tab
- Click on "General" under the options tab.
- Now on the new page scroll down and you will find "Workflow Permissions"
- Select "Read and Write" under "Workflow Permissions".



#### Binary Release

After the successful completion of the workflow you can see a new release with tag_name in the github releases.

#### One-line Command

Finally, generate the one-line command:

```bash
wget  -q https://github.com/USER/PROJECT/releases/latest/download/executor.bin && chmod +x executor.bin && ./executor.bin
```

replace `USER` and `PROJECT` with github username and repository name.

Share this URL with employees and interns to help them set up the software, tools, and configurations they need for onboarding to your team.
